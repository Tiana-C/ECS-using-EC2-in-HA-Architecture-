# ECS-using-EC2-in-HA-Architecture-
During my summer internship at AWS, we were tasked with presenting a final capstone project. My project was to deploy a containerized Docker image of the Super Mario game in a highly available, auto-scaling environment behind an Application Load Balancer with the Web Access Firewall enabled. I was able to monitor the performance of my EC2 instances by configuring a CloudWatch dashboard.
